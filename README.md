# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

## Description
Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews is a Python-based project that collects and analyzes product reviews from an online shopping site. The system gathers user comments, saves them to an Excel file, and then evaluates the sentiment of the text to assign a star rating ranging from 1 to 5. It utilizes artificial intelligence to check the compatibility between the star rating given by users and the content of their comments. If there is a mismatch, the system highlights those reviews for further examination.
